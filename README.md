# Number-Guessing-Game
This Python project is a number guessing game. Users set a range, and the program randomly selects a number within it. Players have limited attempts to guess the correct number. Feedback is provided after each guess. The game ends when the player guesses correctly or exhausts attempts. Interactive and engaging!
